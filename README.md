# Discord Notifier

Discord Notifier provides a bridge between Jenkins and Discord through the built-in webhook functionality.

## The purpose

The Jenkins Discord Webhook plugin was made to share results of a build to a Discord channel using the webhooks that Discord provides. 

Through this plugin you are able to:
 - [x] Get success and fail messages about your build
 - [x] Link to build artifacts
 - [x] List SCM changes to the build
 - [x] Only send notifications on state change

## Download

You'll have to manually install the plugin via the advanced tab of your plugin settings.
A Jenkins plugin repo build will be available soon.

## Usage

This plugin uses the post-build feature to execute a request.

After installing, go to your job's configure section and add the *Discord Notifier* item. Then proceed to enter your webhook URL.

There are a few options you can choose from:
 - Webhook URL
   - The URL of the webhook (pretty self-explanatory) provided by Discord
 - Send only on state change
   - Checking this will only send the message when the state of the current build differs from the previous
 - Advanced:
   - Enable URL linking
     - Enables the title, build summary and build id to be linked to the build. Requires the URL to be set in Jenkin's global configuration
   - Enable artifact list
     - Enables the listing of the artifacts generated by the build
   - Enable version info in footer
     - Adds the "Jenkins version, Discord Webhook version" text in the footer of the message
